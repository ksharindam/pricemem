# PriceMem
A product price management tool for small shop business.  

### Description

I run a small business, where I have difficulties with remembering price of some products.  
So I created this app.

With this app you can -  
* Save each product details (sell price, cost price, photo, brand, description).  
* View purchase history for each product.  
* View purchase history datewise for all products.  


### Download

For Linux download .AppImage package, mark it executable, and double click to run.

* python3  
* python3-pyqt5

Then inside data/ dir, exec compile_rc. The resource file will be generated.  

Then inside project root directory, run following command..

To uninstall run..
